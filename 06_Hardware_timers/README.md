# INRO TO HARDWARE TIMERS

## GOALS AND UNDERSTANDING:
1. Understand the concept of hardware timers and their applications in embedded systems.
2. Learn how to configure and use hardware timers on a microcontroller.
3. Implement a simple application using hardware timers to generate precise time intervals for a single LED.
Understanding how to read from the arduino datasheet and use it to configure the hardware timers to use fast pwm mode.
4. This can be used to set a motor to a particular constant speed by setting the duty cycle to a particular value.

head over to the code and read comments to understand it.

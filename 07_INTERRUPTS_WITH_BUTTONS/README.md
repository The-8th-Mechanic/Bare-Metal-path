# LEARN INTERRUPTS WITH BUTTONS AND LED

## GOALS
1. Learn how to use Interrupts to react to button presses.
2. Use the built-in pull-up resistors to avoid needing external components.
3. Use the built-in LED on Pin 13 to ive feedback when the buttons are pressed.
4. Use the timer to control the brightness of the LED with PWM,and use the buttons to increase or decrease the brigntnes.

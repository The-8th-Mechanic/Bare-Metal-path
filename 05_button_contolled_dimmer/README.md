# BUTTON CONTROLLED PWM

## GOALS:

- To control the brightness of an LED using a button and PWM (Pulse Width Modulation).
- To understand how to use a button to increase or decrease the duty cycle of a PWM signal, which in turn controls the brightness of the LED.
- When we press the red button, the brightness of the LED will increase, and when we press the green button, the brightness will decrease.
-To learn how to store past states of the button in a variable. This helps the to remember where it was last,even when u are not pressing the button.
